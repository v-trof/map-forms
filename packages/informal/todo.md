- [x] input
- [x] submit
- [x] reactivity
- [x] validators
- [x] validaiton that does not use any fields -> understand zod errors deeper
- [x] alt
- [x] array
- [x] try number (counter)
- [x] try select 
- [x] recursive current / valid
- [x] constant doesn't widen type
- [x] data mapping for sub forms
- [x] filling in initial values
- ❗️❗️❗️[x] parsed field (check that number is indeed number)
- [x] try number (text field, with ui)
- [ ] play with ui kit integration (probably force custom components after all)
- [x] try porting old suggest as custom field (store)

❗️❗️❗️[x] ideally make "getValidValue" enough and do not requrie getError
